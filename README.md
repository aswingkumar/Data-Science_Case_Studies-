- The growth of customer service evaluation through data-driven approaches has become essential in todayâ€™s service industries, including healthcare. This case study focuses on natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the customer service experience within dental practices in New York City. Using a dataset sourced from Yellow Pages, which contains close to 1,000 entries on dental services, this study explores multiple facets of NYC's dental care landscape. Key data points such as the names, addresses, phone numbers, websites, customer ratings, and review snippets of dental practices are included, offering a rich basis for analysis. The dataset serves as a valuable tool for data science applications such as sentiment analysis, geographic service distribution studies, and trend spotting in dental care quality. By combining textual insights from patient reviews with numerical customer satisfaction data, we aim to enhance understanding of the factors that influence patient experience and dental service quality in New York City.
